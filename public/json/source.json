Moving the cursor in middle of those span elements will expand those elements into markdown source. Below is an explanation of the syntax for each span element.</p>","<h3 id='Links-0'>Links</h3>","<p>Markdown supports two styles of links: inline and reference.</p>","<p>In both styles, the link text is delimited by [square brackets].</p>","<p>To create an inline link, use a set of regular parentheses immediately after the link text’s closing square bracket. Inside the parentheses, put the URL where you want the link to point, along with an optional title for the link, surrounded in quotes. For example:</p>","<pre>","<code>This is [an example](http://example.com/ \"Title\") inline link.</code>","<code>[This link](http://example.net/) has no title attribute.</code>","</pre>","<p>will produce:</p>","<p>This is <a title='an example' href='http://example.com/ \"Title\"'>an example</a> inline link. (<code>&lt;p&gt;This is &lt;a href=\"http://example.com/\" title=\"Title\"&gt;</code>)</p>","<p><a title='This link' href='http://example.net/'>This link</a> has no title attribute. (<code>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://example.net/\"&gt;This link&lt;/a&gt; has no</code>)</p>","<h4 id='Internal Links-0'>Internal Links</h4>","<p><strong>You can set the href to headers</strong>, which will create a bookmark that allow you to jump to that section after clicking. For example:</p>","<p>Command(on Windows: Ctrl) + Click <a title='This link' href='#block-elements'>This link</a> will jump to header <code>Block Elements</code>. To see how to write that, please move cursor or click that link with <code>⌘</code> key pressed to expand the element into markdown source.</p>","<h4 id='Reference Links-0'>Reference Links</h4>","<p>Reference-style links use a second set of square brackets, inside which you place a label of your choosing to identify the link:</p>","<pre>","<code>This is [an example][id] reference-style link.</code>","<code>Then, anywhere <span class='hl-keyword'>in</span> the <span class='hl-object'>document</span>, you define your link label on a line by itself like <span class='hl-keyword'>this</span>:</code>","<code>[id]: http://example.com/  \"Optional Title Here\"</code>","</pre>","<p>In Typora, they will be rendered like so:</p>","<p>This is [an example][id] reference-style link.</p>","<p>[id]: http://example.com/\t\"Optional Title Here\"</p>","<p>The implicit link name shortcut allows you to omit the name of the link, in which case the link text itself is used as the name. Just use an empty set of square brackets — for example, to link the word “Google” to the google.com web site, you could simply write:</p>","<pre>","<code>[Google][]</code>","<code>And then define the link:</code>","<code>[Google]: http://google.com/</code>","</pre>","<p>In Typora, clicking the link will expand it for editing, and command+click will open the hyperlink in your web browser.</p>","<h3 id='Images-0'>Images</h3>","<p>Images have similar syntax as links, but they require an additional <code>!</code> char before the start of the link. The syntax for inserting an image looks like this:</p>","<pre>","<code>![Alt text](/path/to/img.jpg)</code>","<code>![Alt text](/path/to/img.jpg \"Optional title\")</code>","</pre>","<p>You are able to use drag & drop to insert an image from an image file or your web browser. You can modify the markdown source code by clicking on the image. A relative path will be used if the image that is added using drag & drop is in same directory or sub-directory as the document you're currently editing.</p>","<h3 id='Emphasis-0'>Emphasis</h3>","<p>Markdown treats asterisks (<code><i></code>) and underscores (<code>_</code>) as indicators of emphasis. Text wrapped with one <code></i></code> or <code>_</code> will be wrapped with an HTML <code>&lt;em&gt;</code> tag. E.g:</p>","<pre>","<code>*single asterisks*</code>","<code>_single underscores_</code>","</pre>","<p>output:</p>","<p><i>single asterisks</i></p>","<p>_single underscores_</p>","<p>GFM will ignore underscores in words, which is commonly used in code and names, like this:</p>","<blockquote>","<p>wow_great_stuff</p>","<p>do_this_and_do_that_and_another_thing.</p>","</blockquote>","<p>To produce a literal asterisk or underscore at a position where it would otherwise be used as an emphasis delimiter, you can backslash escape it:</p>","<pre>","<code>\\*<span class='hl-keyword'>this</span> text is surrounded by literal asterisks\\*</code>","</pre>","<p>Typora recommends using the <code>*</code> symbol.</p>","<h3 id='Strong-0'>Strong</h3>","<p>A double <code>*</code> or <code>_</code> will cause its enclosed contents to be wrapped with an HTML <code>&lt;strong&gt;</code> tag, e.g:</p>","<pre>","<code>**<span class='hl-keyword'>double</span> asterisks**</code>","<code>__<span class='hl-keyword'>double</span> underscores__</code>","</pre>","<p>output:</p>","<p><strong>double asterisks</strong></p>","<p>__double underscores__</p>","<p>Typora recommends using the <code>**</code> symbol.</p>","<h3 id='Code-0'>Code</h3>","<p>To indicate an inline span of code, wrap it with backtick quotes (`). Unlike a pre-formatted code block, a code span indicates code within a normal paragraph. For example:</p>","<pre>","<code>Use the `printf()` <span class='hl-keyword'>function</span>.</code>","</pre>","<p>will produce:</p>","<p>Use the <code>printf()</code> function.</p>","<h3 id='Strikethrough-0'>Strikethrough</h3>","<p>GFM adds syntax to create strikethrough text, which is missing from standard Markdown.</p>","<p><code>&lt;del&gt;Mistaken text.&lt;/del&gt;</code> becomes <del>Mistaken text.</del></p>","<h2 id='HTML-0'>HTML</h2>","<p>You can use HTML to style content what pure Markdown does not support. For example, use <code>&lt;span style=\"color:red\"&gt;this text is red&lt;/span&gt;</code> to add text with red color.</p>","<h3 id='Embed Contents-0'>Embed Contents</h3>","<p>Some websites provide iframe-based embed code which you can also paste into Typora.
